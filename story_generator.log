Error initializing models: Due to a serious vulnerability issue in `torch.load`, even with `weights_only=True`, we now require users to upgrade torch to at least v2.6 in order to use the function. This version restriction does not apply when loading files with safetensors.

Error generating story and descriptions: Input length of input_ids is 72, but `max_length` is set to 50. This can lead to unexpected behavior. You should consider increasing `max_length` or, better yet, setting `max_new_tokens`.
